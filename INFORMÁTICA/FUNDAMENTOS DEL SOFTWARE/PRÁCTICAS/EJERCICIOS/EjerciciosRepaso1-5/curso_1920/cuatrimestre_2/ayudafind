       enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard, thus allowing find to use the pattern with the wildcard during the search for file name matching  instead  of
       file names expanded by the parent shell:
       $ find . -name '*.c' -print
       $ find . -name \*.c -print

BUGS
       There  are  security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard specifies for find, which therefore cannot be fixed.  For example, the -exec action
       is inherently insecure, and -execdir should be used instead.  Please see Finding Files for more information.

       The environment variable LC_COLLATE has no effect on the -ok action.

       The best way to report a bug is to use the form at https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils.  The reason for this is that you will  then  be  able  to  track
       progress  in  fixing  the problem.  Other comments about find(1) and about the findutils package in general can be sent to the bug-findutils mailing list.  To join
       the list, send email to bug-findutils-request@gnu.org.
